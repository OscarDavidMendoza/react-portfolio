<h1>Backend Server with Express</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<h3>The backend server for my portfolio website handles form submissions and sends emails using Nodemailer. It includes features such as rate limiting, content security policy, and logging.</h3>

<h4>Technologies Used</h4>

- **Framework:** Express.js for building the server.
- **Email Handling:** Nodemailer for sending emails.
- **Middleware:** Body-parser for parsing request bodies, cors for enabling Cross-Origin Resource Sharing, helmet for setting various HTTP headers for security, rate-limit for limiting request rates, and Winston for logging.
- **Security:** Content Security Policy (CSP) to mitigate Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks.
- **Environment Variables:** Used dotenv to load environment variables.
- **Logging:** Logtail for centralized logging.

<h4>Setup Instructions</h4>>
<p>To set up the portfolio website locally, follow these steps:</p>

- **Clone the repository:** git clone <https://github.com/OscarDavidMendoza/react-portfolio.git>
- **Navigate to the project directory:** cd <MY-PORTFOLIO-REACT> && <MY-PORTFOLIO-REACT/Client>
- **Install dependencies:** `$ npm install`
- **Create a .env file and add your email credentials and Logtail source token.**
- **Start the development server:** `$ npm run dev`
<p>Open your web browser and go to http://localhost:3001 to view the website. This will also start a server on [port:5001](http://localhost:5001.) for the email server (More details below).</p>

Remember to add your environment variables in a .env file for the server to function.

<p>**Variables to add to your .env file**</p>
- NODEMAILER_ENV_USER =**your email address**
- NODEMAILER_ENV_PASS =**your email password**
  - I recommend the use of an app password. You can use this [document](https://support.google.com/mail/answer/185833?hl=en "document") as guidance.
- LOGTAIL_SOURCE_TOKEN =<your logtail token from logtail.com> // This is used to log information of the email server use. Itt is logged in a created file named email.log and on logtail.com.

<h4>Endpoints</h4>

- POST /send-email: Endpoint for handling form submissions. Expects a JSON payload with name, email, and message fields. Sends an email with the provided information.

<h4>Hosting</h4>
In the future, we plan to host this on AWS detailing and documenting this process in a blog post.

<h4>Additional Notes</h4>
- **Responsiveness:** The website is designed to be responsive and work well on different screen sizes.
- **Continuous Improvement:** I'm continuously improving and updating the website to enhance its functionality and design.
- **Rate Limiting:** Limits requests to 5 requests within a 15-minute window to prevent abuse.
- **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Sets a strict CSP to mitigate XSS attacks by specifying allowed sources for scripts, images, and styles.
- **Logging:** Utilizes Winston and Logtail for centralized logging of server activities.
- **Error Handling:** Returns appropriate HTTP status codes and error messages for invalid requests or server errors.
